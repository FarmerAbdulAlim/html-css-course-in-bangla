### HTML Entities
---
Some characters are reserved in HTML. If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
***Here are the list of some HTML Entities:***
| Entity |            Description            | Entity Name |
|:------:|:---------------------------------:|:-----------:|

|    <   |             less than             |     `&lt;`    |
|    >   |            greater than           |     `&gt;`    |
